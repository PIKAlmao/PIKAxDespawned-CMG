### <mark style="color:blue;">Twitter reward system:</mark>&#x20;

The link twitter system isn't really working due to how limited the api system is, it only allows a certain amount of uses per day which is 20 or something from what i've heard, so they usually get used instantly, might be worth having a try right after midnight or after the daily 10am restart, i'm not 100% sure on when the api gets refreshed.\
