<mark style="color:blue;">**Car garage menu not popping up**</mark>:\
If you're on a car spawner and the menu is not popping up, this is due to the fact that it is a <mark style="color:blue;">**VIP**</mark>: car garage that requires the supporter rank + purchasing the supporter rank, gives you access to alot more car spawners / garages around the map, and a new respawn location known as "vip island", you also get a 500k money bag along with being able to choose a vip car of your choice ingame via the /store menu.

<mark style="color:blue;">**"Steam account not found"**</mark>:\
The reason this message appears when you try to join the server is because your steam account is an identifier for the server (to detect ban evaders / cheaters etc...), to fix this issue, you must close fivem fully, then go and open your steam fully (you must have an account), then you can launch fivem again whilst still having steam fully open and you'll be able to join the server perfectly fine. (It does not matter which launcher you have gta purchased on whether it's epic games, steam or the rockstar launcher, you just have to follow the steps above).

<mark style="color:blue;">**Server appearing offline but showing online in the #status section of the discord**</mark>:\
If the server is appearing offline whilst it's not meant to (only times the server should appear offline is during the daily restart at 10am which takes about 15-25 minutes), if you open your f8 console whilst having fivem open and paste in the servers connect, and paste the following <mark style="color:blue;">**"connect s1.cmg.city"**</mark>:

<mark style="color:blue;">**Unable to connect to the server ?**</mark>:\
A couple of causes of this could result in fivem being down (happens frequently) which you can check the status of fivem via this link <mark style="color:blue;">**https://status.cfx.re/**</mark>:. Or the actual CMG server is down having maintenence, they're fixing something important, or the dedicated machine is having issues which you can check via this link. <mark style="color:blue;">**"https://status.cmgstudios.net/"**</mark>:

<mark style="color:blue;">**Stuck beneath the map ?**</mark>:\
If you're stuck under the map, try the following commands which should work and teleport you above the map. <mark style="color:blue;">**/unstuck**</mark>: / <mark style="color:blue;">**/reset**</mark>: , if neither work do <mark style="color:blue;">**/calladmin**</mark>: and wait for them to take your ticket.
