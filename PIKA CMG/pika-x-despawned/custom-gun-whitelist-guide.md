# ðŸ”« Custom gun whitelist guide

### General information:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can purchase a Custom gun whitelist off the [store ](https://store.cmgstudios.net/category/custom-whitelists), or by purchasing them off another player in-game.\
\
Purchasing a custom gun whitelist slot allows you to gain access to someone else's custom weapon without paying full price! However the original owner must give you access to purchase this by giving you an access code.
{% endhint %}

### How to create an access code for a whitelisted weapon as an import owner:

> If you go in-game and press f2 it will open a menu which then will show a category called "Weapon Whitelists" Which you can see in the image below **(ref1)**. \
> \
> Once you press on "Weapon whitelists" it will display your weapon imports that you own, which then you can select the weapon you want to create an access code for, it will then get you to put the players perm id in that's purchasing the access code shown in image below **(ref2)**, this locks it to their account so no one else can claim / steal it.\
> \
> Once a player has an access code to your weapon they'll need to purchase a suitable custom weapon whitelist and enter their access code that you have generated for them. shown below in the image below **(ref3)**.
