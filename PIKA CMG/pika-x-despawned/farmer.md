### Clocking on :clock1: <a href="#clocking-on" id="clocking-on"></a>

1.  To start any job you need to clock on as it before hand at **City Hall.**

    ![](https://1547828078-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F9OKdgP0BI4PujRLZgRNL%2Fuploads%2FBwaQKah1uy4c37pMwTMs%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=ce07bf53-86cd-409d-b690-807713ad0c70)

    ![Once you have clocked on you will receive a prompt telling you a waypoint has been set to where you can start your first job as a newly hired Farmer.

    ![A waypoint will have been placed on your GPS view this via the hotkey ESC.
    (You have to go to the docks and cross over the cayo bridge to get to this island)
    ](<../.gitbook/assets/Farming on CMG1.png>)

    2. Once you have arrived at your destination there should be a male stood next to a red circle which will bring up a prompt for you to "start-job" and or view the field status' !

    * Once you have selected "start-job", you will be given a second prompt requiring you to "Request-Equipment" which will then spawn you a Tractor and a Trailer which you will need to attach.

    </div>

    4. Once you have attached the Trailer to the Tractor, you will be prompted to head to a designated field and will be given a certain task to complete.

    ![Heading to the designated field!](<../.gitbook/assets/Farming on CMG5.png>)

    5. Once you're on the field you will be prompted with a task like "Harvest the remaining crops with your Tractor", and will be shown a counter in the bottom right of how many you have left to harvest / complete.

    <div>

    </div>

    6. You have completed your first job as a Farmer!

{% hint style="success" %}
This job is continuous so it will continue for as long as you continue detaching your trailer at the warehouse and collect a new one. Enjoy! ‚Äã
