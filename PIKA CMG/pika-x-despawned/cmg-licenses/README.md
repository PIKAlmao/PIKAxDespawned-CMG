# ðŸ’Š CMG Licenses

## <mark style="color:blue;">All licenses can be purchased within the city hall</mark>

> Legal Licenses means that you can not be robbed when selling, and that the money goes straight into your bank instead of cash

> Illegal Licenses means that you can be robbed when selling, and that you receive the money in cash (Dirty cash)

> Please bare in mind with illegal licenses and selling that the sell points have turfs that players can capture and change the commission on, so the money you receive from selling can vary a few thousand.
