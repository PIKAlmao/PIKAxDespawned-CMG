### How do i use my lock-slot ?

> **First of all you'll want a car model, these can vary in price depending on the modeler, model or website you're purchasing off. The vehicle can't be the same as an already existing vehicle within the server. You can find all of the already existing baller locks within the server** [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t3IRfvpqkzACCBRbScHsXrOJ1NTjyOWQuJpg9asVKZ8/)**. If you have a model in mind, you can ask on the** [**donation support discord**](https://discord.gg/ge3ZSCYkkH) **by making a **<mark style="color:yellow;">**BALLER**</mark>** ticket and providing images of the model and they'll check it for you and approve it if it's allowed.**\
> \
> **You can find your lock-slot code by doing /store, go over to your "Lock Slot" and press enter and it'll show a new pop up like the following below, which will show your lock-slot code.**

### What to do once your vehicle has been approved by donation support:

> **Once donation support have approved your vehicle that you'd like to import, provide them with the following information. First of all being your perm id then your lock-slot code which you can find shown above (example code above is expired). You'd also need to provide your model file within the ticket. If you want to make your car a 1:2 or 1:3 and so on you'd need to provide 1 import slot code as well to account for the second vehicle (1:2).**
