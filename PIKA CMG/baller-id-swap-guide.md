# Baller ID Swap Guide

### How do i obtain a baller id swap ?

{% hint style="info" %}
To obtain an ID Swap token this would require purchasing the ["Baller Rank" ](https://store.cmgstudios.net/category/ranks)on the store. There has been a new system implementation that now allows players to claim whichever id they want without having to make a [donation support ticket](https://discord.gg/ge3ZSCYkkH)! How to do this will be explained below in the following images / text.
{% endhint %}

### What to do once you have purchased the baller rank

> Once you have purchased the baller rank you will receive the following, <mark style="color:blue;">**4**</mark> [VIP vehicles](https://cmgstudios.net/forums/index.php?/imports/vip/), a <mark style="color:blue;">**Â£25,000,000 money bag**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**5**</mark> [custom import slots](https://cmgstudios.net/forums/index.php?/imports/catalogue/), <mark style="color:blue;">**1**</mark> [lockslot](https://wiki.cmgstudios.net/cmg-store/lockslot-guide) and finally your <mark style="color:blue;">**Baller ID**</mark> Swap token. If you do /store in-game you should be able to see something called a "Baller ID" (shown in image ref1). (Amount of items & money when buying baller rank will depend on whether you use the rank upgrade system or buy the rank individually)\
> \
> If you press ENTER on it then select "redeem item" you will then have a list that will pop up (shown in image ref2), you will then be able to select enter on an id of your choice that's on the list (The list will be updated frequently or as often as they can), to claim the id go to the very bottom list to select the confirmation process.

### Once i have confirmed my Baller ID selection

> Once you have confirmed your Baller ID swap, it will now begin the account migration process  which will transfer all of the data from your current id over to your new one, this will kick you from the server almost instantaneously and can take a few minutes to process before allowing you to join the server again.&#x20;

### How do i know the account migration system worked ?

Once you're back in the server do /getmyid in chat and it will display your new id on the left of your screen and or in chat!
